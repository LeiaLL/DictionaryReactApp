# React Dictionary App

## Description

This is a Dictionary App built with React that allows you to look up the definition of any English word. This app uses a free dictionary API accessible on GitHub here: [https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI]( https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI)


## Features

This React Dictionary App allows you to look up the definition of English words as well as access words synonyms and different example use cases.  The search result will also include pictures that match the word. Additionally, this app also has an audio feature that can play not only the pronunciation of a word, but also the pronunciation in different accents including the British and American accent(where there is a difference in pronunciation).

## Project Status 

This app is a fully functional dictionary for the English language. In the future, this project will be extended to also include other languages as well. As someone who is quadrilingual, I know how tiresome it is having to switch between applications to look up a definition for different languages. So, this app will be updated to allow users to easily switch between language settings and look up any word in a different language.
